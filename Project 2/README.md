# Data Visualization Project 2 - Cart 263

## What is the Project about?
Using a data file, the idea of the project was to represent the data within the dataset in a creative way.

## Explaination of the project!
The idea was to create a climate change related project. The dataset selected showed different years and the different levels of c02 and even more... The main focus was to represent the c02 levels in a creative way. The project consist of 2 main elements: the background of an earth and arcs. Each arc represent a different year and its properties is also influenced by the year's c02 level. In total, there are 30 represented years which is shown within the different radiuses. The arc animation (heartbeat and fade the arcs in a counter-clockwise manner) was used to create a sense of the earth if it had a heart. The counter-clockwise fade represents a missed beat. The neutral theme was also selected to represent a rather "Dark" feeling.
